# Netlify Deployment Checklist ✅

Use this checklist to ensure a smooth deployment to Netlify.

## Pre-Deployment

- [x] ✅ `netlify.toml` created with build configuration
- [x] ✅ `public/_redirects` created for SPA routing
- [x] ✅ `.env.example` created for reference
- [x] ✅ `.gitignore` includes `.env` files
- [ ] ⚠️ Code committed and pushed to Git repository
- [ ] ⚠️ Backend API is deployed and accessible

## Deployment Steps

1. [ ] Connect repository to Netlify
   - Go to [app.netlify.com](https://app.netlify.com)
   - Import existing project
   - Select your repository

2. [ ] Verify build settings (auto-detected from `netlify.toml`)
   - Build command: `npm run build`
   - Publish directory: `dist`

3. [ ] Set environment variables in Netlify dashboard
   - `VITE_API_URL` - Your backend API URL (use https://)
   - `VITE_WS_URL` - Your WebSocket URL (use wss://)
   - `VITE_API_KEYS_ONLY` - Set to `false` (or `true` if needed)
   - `VITE_IDMETA_API_KEY` - Optional, only if needed

4. [ ] Deploy the site
   - Click "Deploy site"
   - Wait for build to complete (~2-3 minutes)

## Post-Deployment Verification

- [ ] Site loads at `https://your-site.netlify.app`
- [ ] All routes work (test navigation)
- [ ] Login functionality works
- [ ] API calls succeed (check browser console)
- [ ] WebSocket connections work (check browser console)
- [ ] No errors in browser console
- [ ] SSL certificate is active (automatic)

## Important Notes

⚠️ **Backend CORS**: Make sure your backend allows requests from your Netlify domain

⚠️ **WebSocket**: Use `wss://` (secure) not `ws://` for production

⚠️ **Environment Variables**: Must start with `VITE_` to be accessible in Vite

⚠️ **API URLs**: Don't include `/api/v1` if your backend doesn't use it
